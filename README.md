The main objective is to develop a predictive model that can estimate total bike fare rates based on various factors such as weather, time of day, day of week, etc. This can be useful for businesses or bike sharing service providers to improve their efficiency, understand demand patterns and plan resources accordingly. Since the model is the regression model so, the count of total rental bikes would be the target variable.
